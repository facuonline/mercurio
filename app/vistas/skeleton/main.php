    <p>Welcome to Skeleton. Skeleton is a minimalist, simple Vista built for developers to easily understand how do Mercurio view models work and build their own on top of it's base code.</p>
    <p>Skeleton is highly commented and includes some snippets in hope to give you an idea of what you can build with Mercurio.</p>
    <p>Happy hacking!</p>
